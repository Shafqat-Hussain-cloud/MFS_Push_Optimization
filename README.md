**Key Insights**
1. From the “Top Services By Transaction Count” visualisation, the top services of this MFS are found: Cash in, Recharge, Cash Out and Merchant Payment. Hence, marketing efforts will most likely produce more volume in the services above.

2. From the “Transaction by Hour of Top Services” visualisation, it can be seen that Cash In and Cash Out services follow a similar pattern. Both peak at around 11 am of the day, whereas Recharge peaks around 7 pm. Hence, push marketing communication will most likely be effective for these services around 11 am and 7 pm, respectively.

3. From the “Overall Transaction Count By Hour” visualisation, it can be seen that all service transactions peak at 11 am and 7 pm of the day, which aligns with insight-2 of Cash In, Cash Out and Mobile recharge services. This indicates that consumers will more likely use their MFS apps at these times of day.

4. Lastly, from the “Transaction Count By Date Of Month” visualisation, it can be seen that Cash In and Cash Out peaks around the 29th day of the month. This indicates there is more probability of revenue and/or an increase in usage if marketing communications are done at the end of the month. This may also correlate with the fact that most consumers get their salaries at the end of the month.
